# Password Generator

A simple password generator written in Python. Feel free to use if you would like! This repository also comes with a file to encrypt your password for extra protection. It is just a simple "Ceaser-Cipher" however, so the encryption is not very fancy. But, the passwords generated from these python files shoulde suffice, and are enough to protect you from most hacks.
