# Password Generator

A simple password generator written in Python. Feel free to use if you would like! This repository also comes with another file that lets you encrypt your password for extra protection. It is just a simple "Ceaser-Cipher" however, so the encryption is not very fancy. But, the passwords generated from these python files should suffice, and are enough to protect you from most hacks.
