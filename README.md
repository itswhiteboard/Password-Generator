# Password Generator

A simple password generator written in Python. Feel free to use if you would like! This repository also comes with another file that lets you encrypt your password for extra protection. It is just a simple "Ceaser-Cipher" however, so the encryption is not very fancy. But the passwords generated from these python files are still very strong, and are enough to protect you from most hacks.

Password Encryption / Decryption - Password_Cryptopgrahy.py

# Coming Soon

**PassMan is an updated version coming in the near future with a built in Password Manager, plus all of the features you see here.**
